# PChallenge
For this challenge I used Cucumber, Selenium-Webdriver, and Ruby to meet the requirements.

From the pendo_challenge folder, you should be able to bundle install all of the needed gems once RVM is installed. 

Once set up, you should be able to run the automation test when residing in the pendo_challenge folder using the command below:

      cucumber features/challenge.feature
